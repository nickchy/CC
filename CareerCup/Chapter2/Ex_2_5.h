 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns nodes
 * at the beginning of the loop.
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points
 * to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * EXAMPLE
 * input: A->B->C->D->E->C [the same C as earlier]
 * output: C

/*
 * If we move two pointers, one with speed 1 and another with speed 2, they will end up meeting if the linked list has a loop. Why?
 * Think about two cars driving on a track, the faster car will always pass the slower one!
 * The tricky part here is finding the start of the loop. Imagine, as an analogy, two people racing around a track, one running twice as fast as the other.
 * If they start off at the same place, when will they next meet? They will next meet at the start of the next lap.
 * Now, let us suppose Fast Runner had a head start of k meters on an n step lap. When will they next meet? They will meet k meters before the start of the next lap.
 * (Why? Fast Runner would have made k + 2(n - k) steps, including its head start, and Slow Runner would have made n - k steps. Both will be k steps before the start of the loop.)
 *
 * Now, going back to the problem, when Fast Runner (n2) and Slow Runner (n1) are moving around our circular linked list, n2 will have a head start on the loop when n1 enters.
 * Specifically, it will have a head start of k, where k is the number of nodes before the loop. Since n2 has a head start of k nodes, n1 and n2 will meet k nodes before the start of the loop.
 * So, we now know the following:
 * 1. Head is k nodes from LoopStart (n1: k steps from begin to loopstart; n2: 2k steps from begin to the point where k steps from loopstart).
 * 2. MeetingPoint for n1 and n2 is k nodes from LoopStart (as shown above).
 * Thus, if we move n1 back to Head and keep n2 at MeetingPoint, and move them both at the same pace, they will meet at LoopStart.
